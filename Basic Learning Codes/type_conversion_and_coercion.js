//guessing answers
console.log('9' - '5'); // it is 4 number
console.log('19' - '13' + '17'); //it is 617 string
console.log('19' - '13' + 17); // it is 23 number
console.log('123' < 57); // it is false boolean
console.log(5 + 6 + '4' + 9 - 4 - 2); // it is 99 number

//last one will be 1143 that was wrong I think just because of
//when it is reach 114 then start other mathematical expression that is minus part
// then that part 9-4-2=3 then it will convert to string with 114 and the answer
//will be 1143
